description:
    - AI-assisted ideas sketching for designers. A realistic, better-than-paper feel is provided by low-latency Apple Pencil support.
    - I was hired to bring the first version of this modern SwiftUI app to the App Store and then develop more drawing features, the client-side AI module, and communication with the Stable Diffusion backend.
