description:
    - GoLexic helps improve reading and spelling in short daily personalized exercises. It was featured in the German and Canadian App Store in 2024.
    - I developed the speech recognition engine at the heart of the application, based on Apple’s Speech framework. I’m also responsible for the implementation of new reading exercises and other features.
